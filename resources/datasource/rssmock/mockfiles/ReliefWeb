<title>Bangladesh: Bangladesh: Floods and Landslides - Jun 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/ls-2017-000068-bgd</link>
<description>GLIDE number: LS-2017-000068-BGD&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Flash Flood, Flood, Land Slide, Mud Slide&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Bangladesh&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadly mudslides triggered by torrential monsoon rains in southeastern Bangladesh are estimated to have claimed at least 135 lives. This disaster occurred just two weeks after Cyclone Mora killed 9 people and caused significant damage across the region. In addition to mudslides, the rains caused severe flooding in low-lying areas, causing significant damage to road and communication infrastructure. Remote communities in Bandarban, Chittagong and Rangamati districts have been cut off and remain without water, electricity, and food supplies. Communities of Rohingya refugees in Bandarban district may also have been affected. Further mudslides are feared due to continued rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial reports suggest that these mudslides have been the most lethal in Bangladesh’s recent history. The total estimated death toll currently stands at 98 from Rangamati district, 30 from Chittagong district and 7 from Bandarban district. Many others are injured and in need of medical assistance.

<title>Syrian Arab Republic: Syria: Polio Outbreak - Jun 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2017-000066-syr</link>
<description>GLIDE number: EP-2017-000066-SYR&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Epidemic&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Syrian Arab Republic&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been confirmed in the Deir-Ez-Zor Governorate of the Syrian Arab Republic. The virus strain was isolated from two cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), with onset of paralysis on 5 March and 6 May, as well as from a healthy child in the same community. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2067374&quot;&gt;GPEI, 8 Jun 2017&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the confirmation of the first VDPV2 during May 2017, AFP surveillance has been intensified in the Governorate, especially in the Al Mayadeen district. As of 6 June 2017, a total of 58 AFP cases have been reported from the Governorate this year. In addition to the two cases that have tested positive for VDPV2, a further 11 have tested negative for polioviruses, with the remaining samples being under process in the laboratories or being transported to the laboratories...Although access for vaccination is compromised due to prevailing insecurity in Deir Al Zour, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, two campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). The most recent full trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) round was conducted in October 2015; while tOPV rounds conducted in the first four months of 2016 only reached part of the target population of the Deir Al Zour Governorate.

<title>Bangladesh: Tropical Cyclone Mora - May 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2017-000058-bgd</link>
<description>GLIDE number: TC-2017-000058-BGD&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Tropical Cyclone&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Bangladesh, India, Myanmar&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe Cyclonic Storm Mora made landfall in &lt;strong&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt; on 30 May 2017. The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)-Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) estimates that 10,074,699 people were living in regions that were exposed to wind speeds of 120 km/h or more, and that some districts near Cox’s Bazaar and Chittagong were hit with gusts that topped 130 km/h. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were at least six lives lost, as well as 136 people injured, according to the National Health Crisis Management Centre and Control Room of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Government sources have estimated that approximately 52,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 260,000 people in possible need of shelter. In particular, Cox’s Bazaar district was heavily hit, with approximately 17,000 residences damaged. Housing for undocumented Myanmar nationals near Cox’s Bazaar was severely damaged. Rohingya refugees are currently without reliable shelter, food, and fuel. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2055354&quot;&gt;UN RC, 31 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IOM, the cyclone severely impacted makeshift settlements that housed more than 100,000 Rohingyas. In addition to the 17,000 destroyed homes, 243 latrines and tube wells were made unusable, one health facility was impaired, and women and children were exposed to abuse and exploitation due to a lack of safe spaces. On 02 June 2017, the IOM launched a US$3.7-million appeal focused on immediate needs in shelter, health, WASH and protection. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2058084&quot;&gt;IOM, 02 June 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An estimated 3.3 million people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone MORA, which made landfall in Chittagong Division on 30 May. Six people were reportedly killed, 136 people injured and 200,000 people displaced by the disaster. As of 3 June, 540,000 people are estimated to require humanitarian assistance. The most severely affected area has been Cox’s Bazar, where more than 300,000 Rohingya refugees and Undocumented Myanmar Nationals are residing. Six Rohingya settlements in the area have reportedly been severely affected, with up to 70 per cent of shelters as well as latrines, clinics and other infrastructure damaged. Agencies working in Cox’s Bazar and other affected areas, are providing assistance in support of the Government response. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2060694&quot;&gt;OCHA, 05 June 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 13 June, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies launched an appeal for 1,296,519 Swiss francs to help the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) deliver assistance and support to 50,000 people for six months. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2074139&quot;&gt;IFRC, 13 June 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Myanmar&lt;/strong&gt;, TC Mora affected the state of Rakhine, particularly Northern Rakhine. The estimate for total number of people affected by the cyclone in Myanmar is not yet available. However, initial results from Myanmar Red Cross Society rapid assessments, conducted 30 and 31 May, indicated that the storm impacted 12 of 17 townships in Rakhine State. The initial figures showed that 3,517 houses were partially damaged while 967 houses were completely damaged in Maungdaw township. 823 houses were damaged in Sittwe, Minbya and Rathedaung townships. A significant number of longhouses and other infrastructure, including latrines and temporary learning spaces, have been destroyed or severely damaged in existing IDP camps in Sittwe and Pauktaw townships. The most urgent needs identified are food, clean drinking water and other forms of basic assistance, including tarpaulins. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2055564&quot;&gt;IFRC, 1 June 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Myanmar and international and national humanitarian partners are conducting assessments and responding to needs following Tropical Cyclone MORA. As of 2 June, the Government reported that over 4,600 houses were destroyed and 11,700 houses damaged. The most severely affected areas are in the northern part of Rakhine State. In the IDP camps in central Rakhine State, hundreds of shelters, temporary learning spaces and latrines also suffered damage or collapsed due to the strong winds. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2060694&quot;&gt;OCHA, 05 June 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 13 June, official estimates for the total number of people affected in Myanmar were not yet available. Complicating the issue are the decades of protracted tension and communal violence in Rakhine state, where the cyclone hit. Access to some areas, including by humanitarian organizations, remains constricted. Although authorities have allowed some organizations to conduct needs assessments in Maungdaw and Buthidaung, the data is still to be verified and a comprehensive assessment has not been conducted, according to the IFRC. As of 13 June, distribution of NFIs had not yet started in these townships; authorities continued to invoke security concerns to postpone access. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2072694/&quot;&gt;IFRC, 13 June 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Most affected was the Rathnapura district where over 20,000 people faced flash floods. In Galle, Neluwa, Tawalama, Niyagama, Baddegama areas were flooded. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2047169&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, 26 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most severely impacted district is Galle, where 142,149 people (36,314 families) have reportedly been affected. Fatalities have been reported in Gampaha, Galle, Hambantota, Kalutara, Kegalle, Matara and Ratnapura districts, with 46 deaths reported in Ratnapura alone...The UN received an initial request from the Government on 26 May 2017 related to search and rescue efforts. UN agencies are currently supporting the Government’s relief efforts in coordination and mobilizing resources...UNICEF will donate water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC).

(&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2049099&quot;&gt;United Nations Sri Lanka, 27 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that at least 150,000 are women and girls of reproductive age and over 189,000 children are affected by the disaster. To complement the ongoing Government-led response, the HCT is seeking US$22.7 million to address the critical life-saving and protection needs of 374,000 people in seven districts from 1 June to 31 October 2017. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2059074&quot;&gt;UNRC Office, 2 Jun 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 12 June, an estimated 575,600 people are affected by floods and landslides. A total of 213 deaths have been confirmed and 77 people remain missing.

Disaster type: Flood&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Russian Federation&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 10 and 15 May 2017, the destruction of the dam in the district of Ishim (Tyumen region) and water spills across the Ishim river caused massive flooding throughout Tyumen region, in particular, around the town of Ishim. The dam was destroyed due to the huge amount of melting snow and the discharge of water from the reservoir near the city of Petropavlovsk in Kazakhstan. The total number of affected families in Ishim district is to date 1,045. More than 130 houses are waterlogged and damaged and 41 houses fully destroyed. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2041904/&quot;&gt;IFRC, 23 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 23-24 May 2017, heavy flooding occurred in two additional regions – Omsk and Stavropol Kray – in Russia, following earlier floods in Tyumen region. As a result, the total number of affected people in the three regions of Omsk, Stavropol Kray and Tyumen has grown from 1,600 to 15,721 people (including 1,479 children and 668 elderly). The number of worst-affected people is amounting to 4,500 residents in 2,545 families. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2072239/&quot;&gt;IFRC, 12 Jun 2017&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

Disaster type: Severe Local Storm&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Nigeria&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A storm in Maiduguri, on May 6, caused significant damage in 27 IDP camps, destroying around 362 shelters and partially damaging around 831 shelters, 26 latrines blocks and 114 education facilities (108 in Borno and 6 in Yobe). With the onset of the rainy season a flood vulnerability mapping was carried out in the IDP camps in Borno and an estimated 59 IDP camps (out of 164) are at risk of flooding, potentially affecting 70,5862 households (328,000 persons), including 66,000 children under five. The shelter and camp coordination sector is working on drainage issues in camps and UNICEF is prepositioning dewatering pumps to sites with high risk of water-logging.(&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-sitrep-no-9-1-15-may-2017&quot;&gt;UNICEF, 15 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an immediate response to a storm on 2 June 2017, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Nigeria carried out a rapid assessment of camps and camp-like settings in Jere, Kaga, Konduga and Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) between 2 and 3 June to assess the level of damage sustained to the structures. Out of the 44 camps assessed, eight sustained damages of varying degrees, while the remaining were unaffected. One fatality was recorded in Bakasi Camp. In addition to the damage to the shelters, some parts of the camps were flooded.

With the onset of the rainy season a flood vulnerability mapping was carried out in the IDP camps in Borno and an estimated 59 IDP camps (out of 164) are at risk of flooding, potentially affecting 70,5862 households (328,000 persons), including 66,000 children under five. The shelter and camp coordination sector is working on drainage issues in camps and UNICEF is prepositioning dewatering pumps to sites with high risk of water-logging.(&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-sitrep-no-9-1-15-may-2017&quot;&gt;UNICEF, 15 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an immediate response to a storm on 2 June 2017, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Nigeria carried out a rapid assessment of camps and camp-like settings in Jere, Kaga, Konduga and Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) between 2 and 3 June to assess the level of damage sustained to the structures. Out of the 44 camps assessed, eight sustained damages of varying degrees, while the remaining were unaffected. One fatality was recorded in Bakasi Camp. In addition to the damage to the shelters, some parts of the camps were flooded.

<title>Vanuatu: Tropical Cyclone Donna - May 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2017-000045-vut</link>
<description>GLIDE number: TC-2017-000045-VUT&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Tropical Cyclone&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: New Caledonia (France), Solomon Islands, Vanuatu&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 3 May 2017, Fiji Meteorological services provided an early alert for a tropical disturbance (TD21F) which was forming north of Vanuatu. The tropical disturbance developed into Tropical Cyclone Donna (TC Donna), a Category 1 system, around Wednesday midnight. TC Donna had intensified into a Category 3 system in the evening of 5 May local time. It was located about 175 KM west of Torres and 300 KM west northwest of Gaua (Torba Province) in Northern Vanuatu. The Government of Vanuatu raised the alert levels across the northern provinces...Public alerts were issued over radio and via mass text messages sent out by Telecom Vanuatu and Digicel. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2017264/&quot;&gt;IFRC, 5 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 6 May 2017, Torba Province in Northern Vanuatu was the most affected area. According to a quick rapid assessment with Community Disaster Committees on the four islands (Loh, Hui, Tegua and Toga), significant number of houses have been either totally destroyed or damaged. On Loh island, almost all people are sheltered in an evacuation center. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2018184&quot;&gt;Govt. Vanuatu, 6 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 8 May, Tropical Cyclone Donna intensified into a Category 5 storm (winds of up to 215 km/h near the centre and gusts of 300 km/h) as it continues to move across Vanuatu towards New Caledonia. Over the weekend, Torba Province, with a population of about 10,000 people, was severely hit...Preliminary reports indicate significant housing damage; however, communication remain disrupted. The National Emergency Operations Centre was activated and is coordinating the in-country response. No fatalities have been confirmed. On 5 May, the Pacific Humanitarian Country Team offered international assistance to the Government and remains on standby to provide support. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2019274&quot;&gt;OCHA, 8 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropical Cyclone Donna has passed out of the Vanuatu region and the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) gave the all clear on the 9th of May...The Torres Island group in Torba Province remains the most affected area, with other areas in Torba less affected. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2023719&quot;&gt;Govt. Vanuatu, 10  May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information obtained by the assessment team will be used by the NDMO on Monday (15/05/17) to draft a ‘phase 2’ relief plan. This plan will be presented to clusters and partner agencies on Tuesday (16/05/17) at the Inter Agency Meeting...Clusters are continuing to make initial remote assessments, preparing response plans and gathering information on available resources for response. This information should also be shared with the NEOC. The NDMO is also considering the need for a long-term recovery plan for community infrastructure (such as schools) damaged during Tropical Cyclone Donna. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2030624&quot;&gt;Govt. Vanuatu, 12  May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the phase 2 activities, the NEOC worked with partners to source the needed supplies which were transported by the Vanuatu Patrol Boat ‘RVS Tukoro’ which was supported by the Australian Government. The vessel departed Port Vila on 16th May 2017 and will deliver supplies to Hiu, Metoma, Tegua, Loh and Toga Islands. Supplies included personal hygiene kits, tarpaulins, shelter kits, teacher tents, water kits, jerry cans and planting materials. The Provincial Disaster Office vessel from Sola will be taken to Torres to assist with relief operations. Reports were received from Hiu on Sunday 14th May 2017 regarding contaminated water and increased cases on diarrhoea. The NDMO sourced 200 cartons of water which was transported to Hiu by the French Navy Patrol Boat ‘La Gloriuese.’ The vessel departed Port Vila that afternoon and delivered the water to Hiu on 16th May 2017. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2034439&quot;&gt;Govt. Vanuatu, 17  May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shelter cluster team assessment report, dated 14 May 2017, identifies the total number of households in Torres to be 190 (population: 1,006). Based on the advice and experience of VRCS in the region, VRCS proposes that, for the purposes of planning the NFI distribution and to enable flexibility within the response, this figure be rounded to 200 households (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2039049&quot;&gt;IFRC, 19 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

<description>GLIDE number: EQ-2017-000050-KGZ&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Earthquake&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Kyrgyzstan&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 3 May 2017, an earthquake of 5.9 magnitude occurred in northern and central-northern Tajikistan near the border with Kyrgyzstan (at a depth of 10 kms), with the epicenter being 120 kilometers away from the city of Batken and 192 kilometers from the city of Osh in southern Kyrgyzstan. Several aftershocks occurred on the same and the following days, with another strong earthquake of 5.8 magnitude registered in the same area on 5 May 2017 (at a depth of 10 kms). While there were, fortunately, no human fatalities in Kyrgyzstan, the earthquakes resulted in severe damages of infrastructure, including educational and health facilities and houses in the district of Chong Alay of Osh province as well as the district of Kadamjai in Batken province.

<title>Kenya: East Africa: Armyworm Infestation - Mar 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/2017-000041-ken</link>
<description>GLIDE number: IN-2017-000041-KEN&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Insect Infestation&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As millions of east African farmers seek to recover from a devastating drought, they face a new threat – the fall armyworm. The pest has been recently detected in Kenya and is suspected to have entered the country from Uganda. It is also known to be present in Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda. The fall armyworm was first reported in western Kenya by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2002359&quot;&gt;FAO, 25 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 23 May, Fall Armyworm has affected more than 143,000 hectares of land in major maize and wheat-producing counties. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Ministry of Agriculture have adopted a planning response figure of 800,000 hectares, which requires US$33.5 million for pesticides and awareness campaigns in the medium term. US$6.6 million is required for an immediate response. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2041984&quot;&gt;OCHA, UN Country Team, 23 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Haiti: Haiti: Floods - Apr 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2017-000043-hti</link>
<description>GLIDE number: FL-2017-000043-HTI&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Flash Flood, Flood, Land Slide&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Haiti&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 20 to 24 April 2017, heavy rainfall caused floods and landslides in the departments of the South, South East, Grand&amp;#39;Anse and Nippes. The South department is the most affected. Initial estimates indicate 4 deaths, 15 homes destroyed, and nearly 10,000 homes that could have been damaged in the South Department. According to the Delegate of the Department of the South, 80% of the spring harvest could have been destroyed.  Six communes - Chantal, Les Anglais, Chardonnieres, Les Coteaux, Port-à-Piment and Tiburon - have been inaccessible since April 23 due to the severe erosion of the road linking Port Salut and the west coast, hindering access. The humanitarian community has deployed teams to conduct a first multi-sectorial needs assessment in the 12 most affected municipalities.The Departmental Delegation of the South estimates that 350,000 people have been affected. In addition, IOM states that the 197 families displaced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2016-000106-hti&quot;&gt;Hurricane Matthew&lt;/a&gt; in Cavaillon are also affected by the floods situation. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2005674&quot;&gt;OCHA, 25 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;). Bean crop yields in the region were significantly affected and are likely to be reduced by as much as half in parts of Sud and wider areas of Grand’Anse department due to the localized flooding. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/haiti-key-message-update-may-2017&quot;&gt;FEWS, May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les dégâts causés par les pluies qui se sont abattues sur les départements du Sud, du Sud-Est, de la Grand’Anse et des Nippes continuent à être évalués. Le département du Sud reste le plus touché et en particulier les douze communes d’Aquin, Arniquet, Camp Perrin, Cavaillon, Les Anglais, Les Cayes, Les Chardonnières, Maniche, Port-Salut, Roche-à-Bâteau, Saint Louis du Sud, et Torbeck.
La Direction de la Protection Civile (DPC) a annoncé qu’approximativement 15.000 ménages ont été affectés avec un besoin d’assistance humanitaire immédiate. Une partie de ces personnes affectées s’étaient retrouvées en situation de vulnérabilité suite à l’ouragan Matthew. Selon les informations collectées sur le terrain jusqu&amp;#39;à présent, le déplacement de familles vers les centres d&amp;#39;évacuation n&amp;#39;est pas significatif. La plus grande partie des familles retrouvées par les équipes d’OIM dans des centres d&amp;#39;évacuation sont déplacées depuis l&amp;#39;ouragan Matthew et 400 familles ont été recensées jusqu’à présent par les autorités locales et l’OIM. Selon les informations recueillies auprès des autorités locales sur la situation du déplacement, l&amp;#39;école Nationale de Dory à Maniche abrite 100 familles déplacées dont la majorité sont déplacées depuis l&amp;#39;ouragan Matthew. Selon l’OIM, l’Ecole Nationale Mixte de Torbeck abrite 32 familles dont seulement 7 familles de plus que celles qui avaient été déplacées à cause de l’ouragan Matthew. Egalement l’OIM a rapporté que, à Port-Salut, les centres d’évacuation École Aubris de Dupin et École Nationale de Douyon continuent à abriter des déplacés de l’ouragan Matthew (30 et 16 familles respectivement). D&amp;#39;après le prêtre de l’église catholique de Port-Salut, 35 familles sont déplacées suite aux inondations dans la salle paroissiale du Presbytère qui est utilisée comme école depuis l’ouragan Matthew.

&lt;p&gt;From 20 to 24 April 2017, heavy rainfall caused floods and landslides in the departments of the South, South East, Grand&amp;#39;Anse and Nippes. The South department is the most affected. Initial estimates indicate 4 deaths, 15 homes destroyed, and nearly 10,000 homes that could have been damaged in the South Department. According to the Delegate of the Department of the South, 80% of the spring harvest could have been destroyed.  Six communes - Chantal, Les Anglais, Chardonnieres, Les Coteaux, Port-à-Piment and Tiburon - have been inaccessible since April 23 due to the severe erosion of the road linking Port Salut and the west coast, hindering access. The humanitarian community has deployed teams to conduct a first multi-sectorial needs assessment in the 12 most affected municipalities.The Departmental Delegation of the South estimates that 350,000 people have been affected. In addition, IOM states that the 197 families displaced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2016-000106-hti&quot;&gt;Hurricane Matthew&lt;/a&gt; in Cavaillon are also affected by the floods situation. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2005674&quot;&gt;OCHA, 25 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;). Bean crop yields in the region were significantly affected and are likely to be reduced by as much as half in parts of Sud and wider areas of Grand’Anse department due to the localized flooding. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/haiti-key-message-update-may-2017&quot;&gt;FEWS, May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les dégâts causés par les pluies qui se sont abattues sur les départements du Sud, du Sud-Est, de la Grand’Anse et des Nippes continuent à être évalués. Le département du Sud reste le plus touché et en particulier les douze communes d’Aquin, Arniquet, Camp Perrin, Cavaillon, Les Anglais, Les Cayes, Les Chardonnières, Maniche, Port-Salut, Roche-à-Bâteau, Saint Louis du Sud, et Torbeck.
La Direction de la Protection Civile (DPC) a annoncé qu’approximativement 15.000 ménages ont été affectés avec un besoin d’assistance humanitaire immédiate. Une partie de ces personnes affectées s’étaient retrouvées en situation de vulnérabilité suite à l’ouragan Matthew. Selon les informations collectées sur le terrain jusqu&amp;#39;à présent, le déplacement de familles vers les centres d&amp;#39;évacuation n&amp;#39;est pas significatif. La plus grande partie des familles retrouvées par les équipes d’OIM dans des centres d&amp;#39;évacuation sont déplacées depuis l&amp;#39;ouragan Matthew et 400 familles ont été recensées jusqu’à présent par les autorités locales et l’OIM. Selon les informations recueillies auprès des autorités locales sur la situation du déplacement, l&amp;#39;école Nationale de Dory à Maniche abrite 100 familles déplacées dont la majorité sont déplacées depuis l&amp;#39;ouragan Matthew. Selon l’OIM, l’Ecole Nationale Mixte de Torbeck abrite 32 familles dont seulement 7 familles de plus que celles qui avaient été déplacées à cause de l’ouragan Matthew. Egalement l’OIM a rapporté que, à Port-Salut, les centres d’évacuation École Aubris de Dupin et École Nationale de Douyon continuent à abriter des déplacés de l’ouragan Matthew (30 et 16 familles respectivement). D&amp;#39;après le prêtre de l’église catholique de Port-Salut, 35 familles sont déplacées suite aux inondations dans la salle paroissiale du Presbytère qui est utilisée comme école depuis l’ouragan Matthew.

<title>Tajikistan: Tajikistan: Measles Outbreak - Apr 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2017-000047-tjk</link>
<description>GLIDE number: EP-2017-000047-TJK&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Epidemic&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Tajikistan&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles epidemic in Tajikistan started in April 2017 gradually spreading out of Rudaki district to the capital city of Dushanbe and the surrounding districts as well as Khatlon oblast. In mid-April 2017, 263 registered cases of measles were reported, out of which 157 were laboratory confirmed. Based on official data, by 1 May, the number of notified and investigated cases rose from 263 to 345, with 246 (71%) patients hospitalized. No deaths were reported so far.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend of sharp increase in new cases is expected to continue. Out of the 48 new cases recorded during week 16 (17-23 April 2017), 96 per cent were un-immunized. The proportion of affected adults in this outbreak is somewhat higher (16.7%) than during the previous outbreak in 2009 (10.5%). The total proportion of unvaccinated persons affected by the epidemic among the total population increased from 81.9% in week 15 to 84% in week 16.

<title>Niger: Niger: Hepatitis E Outbreak - Apr 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2017-000042-ner</link>
<description>GLIDE number: EP-2017-000042-NER&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Epidemic&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Niger&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health on 19 April declared an outbreak of Hepatitis E that has killed 25 among 86 infected people. Medical assistance and preventive measures are ongoing to curb the disease which is mostly transmitted through contaminated water. &lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2002499&quot;&gt;(OCHA, 24 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak in Niger is closely linked to an unclean water supply and hygiene and sanitation facilities for the 240,000 people who are currently displaced in Diffa. This is a particularly vulnerable population that for years has been suffering the consequences of the conflict between Boko Haram and armies in the region....To contain the outbreak, MSF has been working with the Ministry of Health for several weeks...Additionally, MSF has significantly increased its water and sanitation activities in Kitchendi, Garin Wazan and Toumour villages, where around 135,000 people have settled—the vast majority of which are displaced. The organization also distributed water chlorination tablets, soap and new jerrycans for 16,800 families in these villages. So far, more than 27,900 gallons of water have been treated and jerrycans being used in the community have been cleaned to prevent the spread of the disease.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2004829&quot;&gt;(MSF, 26 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 9 January and 25 April 2017, a total of 164 cases of hepatitis E including 25 deaths (case fatality rate of 15.2%) have been reported.&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2011409&quot;&gt;(WHO, 28 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a risk that the outbreak will intensify. New cases are expected to continue to emerge in new health districts in the region. Diffa region is prone to rapid propagation of the disease due to the prevalent underlying factors, such as limited access to safe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices. The region is inhabited by vulnerable populations, such as refugees, IDPs, and returnees who are at risk of contracting the disease due to their living conditions. The forthcoming rainy season, from June to September, is likely to increase the spread of the disease to neighbouring regions, and will further exacerbate WASH needs among affected populations. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2014909&quot;&gt;ACAPS, 4 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Diffa, as of 23 May, there have been 664 supsect and confirmed cases, with 30 deaths linked to the disease. The notified cases show that women constitute the most vulnerable group of the population. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2047474&quot;&gt;OCHA, 23 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Diffa, as of 30 May, there have been 766 supsect and confirmed cases, with 33 deaths linked to the disease. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2058644&quot;&gt;OCHA, 30 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rwanda: Rwanda: Severe Local Storm - Apr 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/st-2017-000035-rwa</link>
<description>GLIDE number: ST-2017-000035-RWA&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Severe Local Storm&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Rwanda&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 1st April 2017 at 3:00 pm, Gatsibo district located in the Eastern Province of Rwanda experienced heavy rainfall associated with heavy storms which, resulted in destruction of houses and community farm lands in Kiramuruzi Sector Nyabisindu Cell. The affected area is located 36 kilometers from Gatsibo District, 40 kilometers from the Eastern Province office and 70 kilometers from the City of Kigali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary assessment conducted by Rwanda Red Cross staff and volunteers, an estimated 675 people (135 households) have been affected by heavy wind and storms that caused four people to be injured. The affected families are currently accommodated in the nearby communities after their houses were damaged and household materials and shelters destroyed. The affected population were left without basic needs such as food and cloth. Household beddings were also destroyed, creating the need for distribution of blankets, sleeping mats and other Non Food items (NFIs). It has been reported that an estimated 14 hectares of mixed crops were destroyed. As a result, a lack of access to foodstuffs presents a situation that may result in short term food insecurity, especially for children under-five, lactating mothers and elderly people. Other damaged infrastructure includes, latrines and other sanitation facilities. This will increase the risk of diseases outbreak, particularly during the current rainfall season.

<description>GLIDE number: MS-2017-000033-COL&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Flood, Mud Slide&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Colombia&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night of 31 March 2017, increased rainfall caused the Mocoa, Sangoyaco and Mulata Rivers to overflow, which in turn generated a mudslide in the municipality of Mocoa, capital of the department of Putumayo. UNGRD reported that the affected area received 33 per cent of its monthly total of rainfall (130 mm of the 400-mm monthly average) on the night of the disaster. Per reports, 273 people perished and 262 are injured; injured residents have been treated, and the most serious cases have been transferred to medical centres in Neiva, Popayan and Bogota. There have been 399 Restoration of Family Links (RFL) requests, 25 homes have been destroyed and more than 300 families have been affected. According to the latest official report from the UNGRD-coordinated national crisis room, 17 neighbourhoods were affected (29 blocks), with the greatest devastation seen in the districts of San Fernando, San Miguel, Independencia, Chaparros, San Agustín, Naranjito, Pablo VI, Avenida 17 de Julio, Miraflores and Progreso; the hospital network has collapsed, and 85 per cent of the department was left without electricity, which has since been partially restored. Three aqueducts and the sewage system are affected, 10 roads are damaged, 2 bridges collapsed and 5 are being rehabilitated...Following an extraordinary meeting of the Cabinet at Nariño House, the Colombian government has assessed the catastrophe and the need to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected people and infrastructure investments to rebuild Mocoa and decided to declare an economic and social emergency. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/1980799&quot;&gt;IFRC, 7 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of early May 2017, the municipality of Mocoa continues clean up and recovery efforts following the devastating mudslide. The water supply has been restored to nearly 70% of the city. 384 people remain in temporarily shelters, and the government continues to provide food, toiletries, and other care; furthermore, the Government announced the allocation of 20,000 million Colombian pesos for an ambitious housing rehabiliation project.  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2013749&quot;&gt;Government of Colombia, 2 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;

Affected countries: Niger&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29 March, the Government of Niger declared a meningitis epidemic in three health centers of the Niamey II health district. Six health districts are in alert in the regions of Tillabéry, Dosso and Tahoua. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health launched a vaccination campaign on 06 April 2017, exclusively in the three affected districts of Niamey. The vaccination program is targeting people aged 2 to 20 years old, about 10,200 people for the first phase. Currently, the country has only 133,000 doses of vaccines. This limited supply prompted the Minister of Health to start vaccination in Niamey.  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/1998974&quot;&gt;IFRC, 21 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2017-000030-nga</link>
<description>GLIDE number: EP-2017-000030-NGA&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Epidemic&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Nigeria&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 19 March 2017, a total of 1,407 suspected cases of meningitis and 211 deaths have been reported from 40 local government areas in five states of Nigeria since December 2016. Zamfara, Katsina and Sokoto account for 89% of these cases. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/1959979/&quot;&gt;WHO, 24 Mar 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As at April 3, 2017, a total of 2,997 suspected cases of CSM have been reported in 16 States in Nigeria, of which 146 have been laboratory-confirmed. Unfortunately, 336 deaths have also been recorded...A total of 500,000 doses of Meningitis C vaccines have been distributed to some of the affected States for immediate outbreak response vaccination. An additional 823,970 doses of Meningitis C vaccines are expected from the UK to support vaccination activities in other affected States. The Emergency Operations Centre will support State-wide vaccination campaign which starts in Zamfara State on Wednesday the 5th of April, 2017. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/1975264/&quot;&gt;Govt, 4 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of new cases of suspected meningitis being reported has begun to decline as outbreak control measures take effect. A total of 628 new cases were reported in week 16 versus 1,935 in week 15 and 2,127 in week 14. The cumulative number of suspected cases recorded in Nigeria throughout the outbreak period is now 9,646 and 839 deaths from 43 Local Government Areas in 23 states. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/1975264/&quot;&gt;Govt, 26 Apr 2017&lt;/a&gt;)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health sector is supporting the State Ministry of Health and State Primary Health Care Agency in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states to lead the preparedness process for cerebro-spinal meningitis epidemic, which is a looming threat in the region. A draft epidemic preparedness and response plan has been prepared for North-East Nigeria. As of April 13, 2017, a total of 5,695 suspected cases have been reported; included 221 (4%) laboratory confirmed cases; and 611 deaths (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2010804&quot;&gt;WHO, Gov&amp;#39;t Nigeria, Health Cluster, 30 Apr 2017.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meningitis outbreak situation in Nigeria is gradually improving. During week 18 (week ending 7 May 2017), the four most affected states of Zamfara, Sokoto, Katsina and Kebbi observed reduction in the weekly caseload and deaths. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://reliefweb.int/node/2030364&quot;&gt;WHO, 12 May 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Central African Republic: Central African Republic: Severe Local Storm - Mar 2017</title>
<link>http://reliefweb.int/disaster/vw-2017-000029-caf</link>
<description>GLIDE number: VW-2017-000029-CAF&lt;br/&gt;
Disaster type: Severe Local Storm&lt;br/&gt;
Affected countries: Central African Republic&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since January 2017, the Central African Republic has been experiencing series of violent winds. The cities of Mbaïki, Ndolobo, Ndjoh, Lambi and Bossembelé centers located respectively 107 km, 125 km and 157 km from Bangui, faced since 16 March 2017, violent winds following heavy rains, causing major damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 75 volunteers from local branches of the Red Cross, including 25 from Mbaiki, 15 from Ndolobo, 10 from Lambi, 5 from Ndjoh and 20 from Bossembelé, went to the affected neighborhoods and began to assess the situation, provided first aid to the wounded, evacuated the wounded to the hospital and helped resettle the most vulnerable with host families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 445 most vulnerable families were identified by the Red Cross. Specific needs include emergency shelter, access to drinking water and sanitation. Failure to meet these emergency needs will result in a rapid deterioration of living conditions for these vulnerable families, including increased morbidity and mortality from infectious disease and exposure to weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional necessities such as blankets, mats, mosquito nets, tarpaulins, kitchen kits, toilet kits, soaps, buckets, jerry cans, lamps, etc., will help improve the living conditions of these people. Weather forecasts continue to indicate additional flooding is likely in the Central African Republic, which could aggravate the situation of these already vulnerable populations if nothing is done.
