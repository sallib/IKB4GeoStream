The event serves to thank blood donors for their life-saving gift of blood and to raise awareness of the need for regular blood donations throughout the year to ensure the availability of safe blood supplies for patients in need. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">This year’s campaign focuses on blood donation in emergencies. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">Risks to health caused by emergencies, including natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods; and man-made disasters such as road accidents and armed conflicts are a major concern in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">There are more than 76 million people affected by humanitarian emergencies, including almost 16 million refugees and 10 million internally displaced people in the Region, where some of the most affected countries in the world are located.  In these countries, the health systems have been weakened or destroyed and health workers provide health services in insecure and under difficult circumstances. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">Humanitarian emergencies increase the demand for blood transfusion and make its delivery challenging and complex.  An adequate and safe supply of blood can only be assured through a well-organized blood service that is adequately prepared to meet the increase in demand during emergencies. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">In any crisis or emergency situation, the natural human response is “What can I do? How can I help?”. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">You can help to save lives by giving blood regularly and voluntarily, so that sufficient blood is available before

            <description><![CDATA[<p id="_mcePaste">Baghdad, 29 May 2017 – The Government of Japan extended its support to the World Health Organization in March this year with a donation of over US$ 1 million to implement a project to provide integrated lifesaving services in camps for internally displaced people and Syrian refugees in the hosting governorates of Ninewa, Erbil and Duhok. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">Through this initiative, a population of over one million civilians now has access to mobile emergency medical services provided through 2 emergency management coordination centres. The centres are supported by a network of newly procured ambulances staffed by trained paramedics who work in coordination with the centre control rooms operators round the clock.   </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">“As military operations progress towards the old city in west Mosul, there is a sharp increase in the number of displaced populations who require urgent humanitarian response,” said Altaf Musani, WHO Representative for Iraq. “WHO has mobilized all available resources to scale up its support to the national health authorities to respond to the increasing health needs for trauma care, primary health care and referral services. The scale of required support is vast given the presence of nearly 4 million IDPs and over 225 000 Syrian refugees distributed in camps in the governorates of Erbil, Dahok, Suleimaniyah, and the recently liberated areas in Ninewa,” Mr Musani added. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">“We hope that our contribution will help capacity-building of emergency medical personnel and save the lives of as many vulnerable people in Iraq as possible,” said H.E. Mr Fumio Iwai, Ambassador of Japan

The meeting discussed the Sustainable Development Goals, polio eradication and emergencies.</p>
<h3 id="_mcePaste">Sustainable Development Goals </h3>
<p id="_mcePaste">Superseding the Millennium Development Goals, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 goals with 169 targets that all 191 United Nations Member States have agreed to try and achieve by 2030. The goals represent a new transformative agenda for the world which aims to improve economic, social and environmental conditions for populations and the planet through enhancing partnerships, peace and prosperity. WHO has developed tools to measure country progress in achieving the targets of the Goals. SDG 3 is the health-related Goal “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”, and while WHO takes the leadership role in supporting countries to achieve SDG 3, health plays a fundamental role in development and is linked to some targets under SDGs 6, 7 and 11. </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">Strong health information systems are needed to ensure that baseline data are available to track progress and performance. Furthermore, health must be included in the policies of other sectors to ensure improvements in the social, economic and environmental determinants of health. Countries of the Region have committed to achieving the SDGs and the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean will be providing support to countries to develop their capacity to measure and report progress on

            <description><![CDATA[<p id="_mcePaste">Cairo, Egypt, 18 May, 2017 — On this World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling on governments, partners, communities and individuals to stop using tobacco and drive sustainable development. The slogan for this year’s Day is “Say no to tobacco”. Tobacco control can protect health, reduce poverty and promote development.  </p>
<p id="_mcePaste">Each year, more than 7 million people die from tobacco use. This figure includes the 900 000 that die from exposure to secondhand smoke. Over 80% of these deaths occur in low- or middle-income countries. These countries bear almost 40% of the global economic cost of smoking from health expenditures and lost productivity, estimated at over US$ 1.4 trillion.</p>
<p id="_mcePaste">In some countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region, smoking can be as high as 52% among men and 22% among women. Data for young boys and girls are equally alarming. Smoking can reach 42% among boys and 31% among girls. Dr Mahmoud Fikri, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, says, “We can beat tobacco by implementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), and adopting the MPOWER measures to reduce demand for this deadly product. The comprehensive implementation of the WHO FCTC and the MPOWER measures to reduce tobacco use in the Region would lead to a reduction in tobacco use ranging from 20% to 40% in 5 years and, in some countries, by up to 36% in 5 years, and 56% in 15 years.”</p>

The week and its related campaign “Save Lives: #SlowDown” draw attention to the dangers of speed and the measures which should be put in place to address this leading risk for road traffic deaths and injuries. Studies indicate that typically 40–50% of drivers do not adhere to speed limits. Excessive and inappropriate speed is a key road safety risk factor, contributing to about one third

<p>WHO has rapidly distributed medicines and medical supplies, including cholera kits, oral rehydration solutions and intravenous (IV) fluids as well as medical furniture and equipment for diarrhoea treatment centres. Ten new treatment centres are being established in affected areas.</p>
<p>WHO is also supporting health authorities to establish oral rehydration therapy corners to treat mild and moderate dehydration due to diarrhoea. Starting with 10 oral rehydration therapy corners in Sana’a, this approach will be replicated across all affected areas. More severe cases will be referred to the diarrhea treatment centres.</p>
<p>“We are very concerned with the re-emergence of cholera across several areas of Yemen in the past couple of weeks. Efforts must be scaled-up now to contain the outbreak and avoid a dramatic increase in cases of diarrhoeal disease,” said Dr Nevio Zagaria, WHO Representative in Yemen.</p>
<p>Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholera. Most of those infected will have no or mild symptoms but, in severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated.</p>
<p>The uptick in cholera cases comes as Yemen’s already weakened health system struggles under the weight of

The slogan of this year’s campaign is “Fight antibiotic resistance … it’s in your hands”, illustrating the important relationship between good infection prevention and control practices like washing your hands and preventing antibiotic resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>World Hand Hygiene Day plays an important role in highlighting good infection prevention and control practices to change behaviours to reduce the spread of infections and therefore save the lives of millions. Without behaviour change, antibiotic resistance will remain a major threat.</p>

A key component of which is adequate hand hygiene, which plays a critical role in combating antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p id="_mcePaste">“Health care-associated infections are one of the most frequent adverse events in health care delivery and are a major public health problem that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide,” says Dr Mahmoud Fikri, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.&nbsp;</p>
